/**
 * Represents a product search result item returned by the Search pipelet. 
An instance of ProductSearchHit is a wrapper around the actual product returned by the search. The wrapped product can be accessed by method getProduct().
For special product types, the wrapped product can be the representative of other related products actually hit by the search. A variation master or variation group returned by the search represents a collection of hit variants. A product set returned by the search represents a collection of hit set-products. A bundle returned by the search represents a collection of hit bundled-products. If the product wrapped by this ProductSearchHit is the representative of other products, method getRepresentedProducts() can be used to access all these products.
