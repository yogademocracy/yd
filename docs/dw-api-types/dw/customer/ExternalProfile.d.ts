/**
 * Represents the credentials of a customer. Since 13.6 it is possible to have customers who are not authenticated through a login and password but through an external authentication provider via the OAuth2 protocol. In such cases, the AuthenticationProviderID will point to an OAuth provider configured in the system and the ExternalID will be the unique identifier of the customer on the Authentication Provider's system. For example, if an authentication provider with ID "Google123" is configured pointing to Google and the customer has a logged in into Google in the past and has created a profile there, Google assigns a unique number identifier to that customer. If the storefront is configured to allow authentication through Google and a new customer logs into the storefront using Google, the AuthenticationProviderID property of his Credentials will contain "Google123" and the ExternalID property will contain whatever unique identifier Google has assigned to him.
