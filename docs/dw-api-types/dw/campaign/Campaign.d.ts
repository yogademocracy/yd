/**
 * A Campaign is a set of experiences (or site configurations) which may be deployed as a single unit for a given time frame. The system currently supports 3 types of experience that may be assigned to a campaign:

    1. Promotions
    2. Slot Configurations
    3. Sorting Rules

This list may be extended in the future.

A campaign can have a start and end date or be open-ended. It may also have "qualifiers" which determine which customers the campaign applies to. The currently supported qualifiers are:

    1. Customer groups (where "Everyone" is a possible customer group)
    2. Source codes
    3. Coupons

A campaign can have list of stores or store groups where it can be applicable to.
