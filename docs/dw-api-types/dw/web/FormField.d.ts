     *
     - missing-error
     - parse-error
     - range-error
     - value-error

    The framework performs error checks in a specific order, and so if there are multiple errors for a single FormField, the following sequence defines which error is returned:

    - When submitting a form entry, whitespace is first trimmed from user entry and the entry is parsed into native data type (boolean, date, integer, number, or string). A regex, if defined, is also matched against the input. If there is an error while parsing or matching with regex, "parse-error" is set as error.
    - If field was marked as "mandatory" but there is no entry, "missing-error" is returned
    - The min/max and minlength/maxlength checks are performed. If test failed, "range-error" is returned.
    - value-error or form-error are returned when "invalidate()" was called programatically (or pipelet InvalidateFormElement is used)

    If the field is valid, this method returns null. If no error message was specified in the form field definition, this method also returns null.
