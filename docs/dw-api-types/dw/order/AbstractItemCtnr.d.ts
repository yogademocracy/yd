/**
 * Basis for item-based objects stemming from a single Order, with these common properties (Invoice is used as an example):

    - The object has been created from an Order accessible using getOrder()
    - Contains a collection of items, each item related to exactly one OrderItem which in turn represents an extension to one of the order ProductLineItem or one ShippingLineItem. Example: an Invoice has InvoiceItems
    - The items hold various prices which are summed, resulting in a product-subtotal, a service-subtotal and a grand-total, each represented by a SumItem.
    - The object is customizable using custom properties
