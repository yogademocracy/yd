/**
 * Defines extensions to ProductLineItems and ShippingLineItems belonging to an order.

The order-item can be accessed using ProductLineItem.getOrderItem() or ShippingLineItem.getOrderItem() - these methods return null if the item is associated with a basket rather than an order. Alternative access is available using Order.getOrderItem(string) by passing the itemID used to identify the order-item in for example export files. The associated order-item can also be accessed from invoice-items, shipping-order-items, return-items and return-case-items using AbstractItem.getOrderItem().

The order-item provides an item-level status and type, methods for accessing and creating associated items, and methods used to allocate inventory for shipping-order creation.
