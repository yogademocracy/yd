 * The PaymentMethod class represents a logical type of payment a customer can make in the storefront. This class provides methods to access the payment method attributes, status, and (for card-based payment methods) the related payment cards.
A typical storefront presents the customer a list of payment methods that a customer can choose from after he has entered his billing address during the checkout. PaymentMgr.getApplicablePaymentMethods(Customer, String, Number) is used to determine the PaymentMethods that are relevant for the customer based on the amount of his order, his customer groups, and his shipping address.
