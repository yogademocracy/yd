/**
 * The Appeasement represents a shopper request for an order credit.
Example: The buyer finds any problem with the products but he agrees to preserve them, if he would be compensated, rather than return them.

The Appeasement contains 1..n appeasement items. Each appeasement item is associated with one OrderItem usually representing an Order ProductLineItem.

An Appeasement can have one of these status values:

    - OPEN - the appeasement is open and appeasement items could be added to it
    - COMPLETED - the appeasement is complete and it is not allowed to add new items to it, this is a precondition for refunding the customer for an appeasement.
