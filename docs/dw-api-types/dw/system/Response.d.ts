     * Adds the specified cookie to the outgoing response. This method can be called multiple times to set more than one cookie.

If a cookie with the same name, domain and path already exists at the client, it is updated. A cookie can be deleted at the client by submitting a cookie with the maxAge attribute set to 0 (see Cookie.setMaxAge() for more information).

        ```
